Given an integer string, create all integer permutations of its digits. Determine if there is a permutation whose integer value is evenly divisible by 8, i.e. (permutation value) % 8 = 0. For example, the possible permutations of 123 are p = {123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321}. Of these values, p[4] = 312 is divisible by 8 because 312 % 8 = 0.
